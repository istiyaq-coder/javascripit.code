📌 1. The Three Ways to Declare Variables
var a = 10;
let b = 20;
const c = 30;

Keyword	Scope	Reassign?	Redeclare?	Hoisted?
var	Function	✅ Yes	✅ Yes	✅ Yes
let	Block	✅ Yes	❌ No	✅ Yes (TDZ)
const	Block	❌ No	❌ No	✅ Yes (TDZ)
🧠 Mental Model

Think of:

var → old, problematic, avoid in modern JS

let → use when value changes

const → default choice (most used)

👉 As a professional developer:
Use const by default. Use let only when necessary. Never use var.

🔥 2. var (The Dangerous One)
⚠ Function Scoped (Not Block Scoped)
if (true) {
  var x = 10;
}
console.log(x); // 10 😱


Because var ignores block {} and only cares about functions.

⚠ Redeclaration Allowed
var a = 5;
var a = 10; // No error


This can silently break large applications.

⚠ Hoisting Behavior
console.log(a); // undefined
var a = 5;


Internally JS sees:

var a;
console.log(a);
a = 5;


This causes many bugs.

🚀 3. let (Modern & Safe)
✅ Block Scoped
if (true) {
  let x = 10;
}
console.log(x); // ❌ ReferenceError


Much safer and predictable.

❌ No Redeclaration
let a = 10;
let a = 20; // ❌ Error


Prevents accidental mistakes.

⚠ Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)
console.log(a); // ❌ ReferenceError
let a = 5;


Unlike var, it doesn’t give undefined.
It throws an error → safer behavior.

🏆 4. const (Best Practice Default)
❗ Must Be Initialized
const a; // ❌ Error

❗ Cannot Be Reassigned
const a = 10;
a = 20; // ❌ Error

⚠ BUT Objects Can Still Change!
const obj = { name: "Ali" };

obj.name = "John"; // ✅ Allowed


Because:

const protects the reference

Not the internal content

🧠 Think:
const = pointer cannot move
NOT = value is frozen

If you want full immutability:

Object.freeze(obj);

💡 Pro Developer Tips
1️⃣ Always Start With const
const taxRate = 0.2;


If later you need reassignment → change to let.

2️⃣ Avoid var Completely

In interviews, saying:

"I avoid var because of function scope and hoisting issues."

Sounds professional.

3️⃣ Loop Trick

Old JS problem:

for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  setTimeout(() => console.log(i), 1000);
}


Output:

3
3
3


Because var shares the same variable.

Correct version:

for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  setTimeout(() => console.log(i), 1000);
}


Output:

0
1
2


🔥 This is a very common interview question.

🛑 Common Mistakes

❌ Using var in modern projects
❌ Thinking const makes objects immutable
❌ Forgetting TDZ behavior
❌ Reassigning const
❌ Declaring variables too late

🧪 Short Interview Answers

Q: Difference between var, let, and const?

var → function scoped, hoisted, redeclarable

let → block scoped, no redeclaration, TDZ

const → block scoped, no reassignment, TDZ

🎯 Golden Rule (Real Developer Rule)
// 80% of the time
const

// 19% of the time
let

// 1% of the time
var (never in modern code)
